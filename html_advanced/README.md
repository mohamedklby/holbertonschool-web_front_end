HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures content on the web by using a system of elements (also called "tags") to define different parts of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and more. 

### Key Concepts in HTML:
1. **Tags**: These are special codes used to tell the browser how to display the content. Tags are usually enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`), with most tags having an opening tag and a closing tag.
   - **Opening Tag**: `<tag>`
   - **Closing Tag**: `</tag>`
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   ```

2. **Attributes**: Tags can have additional information in the form of attributes. These are placed inside the opening tag.
   - Example of an attribute: `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>`

3. **Nesting**: HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. Proper nesting is important for the structure of the page.

4. **Document Structure**: Every HTML document follows a standard structure that includes essential elements such as `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

   Example of a simple HTML document:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My Web Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
       <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

### Common HTML Tags:
- `<html>`: Defines the entire HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document (like title, character set, etc.).
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page (appears in the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the page.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`: Define headings (h1 is the largest, h6 is the smallest).
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink.
- `<img>`: Embeds an image.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Define unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.

HTML is the foundation of any website, and itâ€™s often paired with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
